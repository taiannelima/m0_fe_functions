# Self-Evaluation

 - Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of? 

I've encountered some errors and that was frustraring me, so I asked a BE classmate, then right after I finished forking and cloning I had another bug, and messaged our group on Slack, got help. then again another issue with git add, commit and push. but i finally realized that I was in the wrong directory and when I tried again, it did work! 
today was a lot of work, and i did get frustrated, but all fixed!


- In your own words, why are functions a powerful tool in our applications?
functions are everything. without it i wouldnt be able to have my code cleaner, efficient, easy to undertand and so on!!!
