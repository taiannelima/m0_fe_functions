// Each example below has at least one opportunity for improvement.

// YOUR TASK:
  // Modify the code to make that improvement(s)
  // write a JS comment to explain what you changed, and why
  // make sure the code you submit WORKS - you can run this entire file 
    // using `node cleanUp.js` or copy and paste into a replit


// EX 1:
function askUserForname () {
  console.log("Hey there, what is your name?") 
 }

askUserForname()
// In this improvenment i changed the functions name to 'askUserName' to be more specific, and changed console.log statement to be a direct question, and added 'Hey' informal language to make it more engaging.


// EX 2:
function addThreeNums(num1, num2, num3) {
let sum = num1 + num2 + num3
return sum;
     }

let result1 = addThreeNums(3, 7, 20);
console.log(Result1 = addThreeNums(3, 7, 20))

// in this improvenment i used 3, 7, 20. I changed the number to personal numbers to me, and i used ''let'' to declare the variables explicity and to make it more modern.



// EX 3:
function makeFreshPesto(){

 console.log("Have ready your: basil, parmesan, romano, olive oil, pine nuts, garlic, salt, pepper");
 console.log("- Add basil and pine nuts in the quantity if fits best to your taste");
 console.log("- Add garlic and cheeses as your wish");
 console.log("- Slowly pour in olive oil");
 console.log("- Sesoning time! Add seasoning as your taste it");    }

makeFreshPesto();






//  EX 4:
function calculateAverage(number1, number2) 
 {
var sum = number1 + number2;
   var average = sum / 2;

return average

 }

 var result = calculateAverage(15,21)
 console.log("The average age that uses TikTok the most: ",  result)
